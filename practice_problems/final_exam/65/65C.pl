% C. Write a PROLOG program that generates the list of all subsets of k
% elements (all elements being odd numbers) in arithmetic progression.
% Write the mathematical models and flow models for the predicates used.

% For example, for L = [1, 5, 2, 9, 3] and k = 3 ->
% [[1, 5, 9], [1, 3, 5]] (not necessarily in this order).
