; D. An n-ary tree is represented in Lisp as
; (node subtree1 subtree2 …).
; Write a Lisp program to return the height of a node of a tree.
; A MAP function shall be used.

; Example for the tree
; (a (b (g)) (c (d (e)) (f)))

; a) nod = e ⇒ the height is 0
; b) nod = v ⇒ the height is -1
; c) nod = c ⇒ the height is 2
