# Functional and Logic Programming (FLP)
This repository contains my solutions to Functional and Logic Programming (FLP) problems written in Prolog and Lisp, completed during my 2nd year at UBB.
It includes laboratory assignments, exams, and practice problems that explore concepts such as recursion, list processing and pattern matching.
