# Functional and Logic Programming (FLP)
This repository contains my work completed throughout the **Logical & Functional Programming** course, completed during my 2nd year at UBB.  
It includes **lab assignments**, **seminar exercises**, **practical tests**, **exam preparation**, and **extra practice problems**, covering both **Lisp** (functional programming) and **Prolog** (logic programming).

The focus of this course was on **recursive thinking**, **declarative problem modeling**, and **reasoning over lists and trees**, rather than **imperative control flow**.
